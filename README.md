"Resume" is the git repository for managing my resume. I hope I actually make use
 of the repository, and don't just forget about it like everything else.

The MMDDYY convention expresses month, day, and year of the log.

Initial Commit.
Start templating the content in a plain-text editor.
Start concepting the resume using mobile-boilerplate and bootstrap. (Overkill?)

Finally had time to finish everything.
Added all semantic content including projects, homepage pictures, resume content, and contact information.
May just need to check all my hyperlinks after it's hosted.
I also need to link to projects from the resume page, set up my hostname for SMTP, and set up a blog.

021013 -
Minor Touch-ups.
Replaces the contact information until everything is finalized with DNS propagation.
Need to add more information into my projects section regarding what I actually built during the project timelines.
